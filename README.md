# House Price Prediction

This project guides you through the entire process of creating a real estate price prediction website. We begin by developing a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression, utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset. The project involves creating a Python Flask server that will host the model and handle HTTP requests. Finally, we'll build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can input details such as square footage and number of bedrooms. The website will then interact with the Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Throughout the model-building phase, we will explore a wide range of data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, detecting and removing outliers, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

Tools & Techniques used:
  i)Front End - HTML, CSS, JS
  ii)Back End - Flask
  iii)Machine Learning - Regression Analysis
